The 'gamer's Clique' is a website where you can find all the accessories which are related to gaming. 
this is a basic website which is created by using HTML and CSS code and this website will be developed for sure and one day this might actually run. The basic outline of this webpage is it should be clean and I took references of many websites and youtube videos(as this is my first webpage).
I've used limited colors not flashy ones and for the animations I kept it simple as I am still yet to master it.
